## Link Lists

To view the link lists related to a specific Store, the admin should select the Store and click on the 'Link lists' widget. The system will open the 'Link lists' blade.

The list contains all the links displayed on Storefront, example 'Footer', 'Main menu', etc. The admin can add additional links which will be displayed on the Storefront and edit the existing ones.

The Main menu and Footer are hard-coded. Any other links can be added by the admin, but they should relate to one of the hard coded link.
